  by default in the chart notes, probes, etc.
- Individual ports can now be enabled / disabled.
- Annotated the values.yaml to better describe what fields do. This is also reflected in the [README.md](README.md) file.

- Moved the primary ingress from `ingress` to `ingress.main`.
- Moved the primary service from `service` to `service.main`.
- Multiple ingress objects can now be specified under the `ingress` key.
- Multiple service objects can now be specified under the `ingress` key.
